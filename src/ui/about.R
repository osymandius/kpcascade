        p("The Key Population (KP) HIV Care & Treatment Cascades available on this platform were develop through a consultative process, facilitated by the South African National AIDS Council (SANAC). SANAC established a KP cascades working group in September 2016 to develop HIV treatment cascades for KP in South Africa. Since then, this KP cascades working group has met and participated in three workshops and several teleconferences. Technical Advisors (TA) from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has provided technical assistance to synthesize data from completed KP HIV Surveillance studies and worked with the group to develop a consensus-based approach towards developing uniform assumptions and methods to enable extrapolation of surveillance data for the development of sub-national treatment cascades for female sex workers (FSW). The cascades development process has been iterative, integrating advances in the fields of KP population size estimation and surveillance."),

        p("The KP cascades working group has endorsed developed cascades to inform multiple KP strategic planning processes, including PEFPAR Country Operational Planning (COP) in 2017, 2018 and 2019; SANACâ€™s midterm reviews of the National Strategic Plan (NSP) 2017-2022, and its companion National Sex Worker HIV Plan (NSWP) 2016-2019 and National LGBTI HIV Plan 2017-2022; and the previous and current round of Global Funded KP programmes. This process has enabled diverse stakeholders to become familiar with existing KP surveillance and related data and build capacity around cascade development and utilisation for planning, monitoring, evaluation and other purposes. It is envisioned that the KP cascades group will continue to meet on at least annually to review these cascades and update them in relation to newly available data."),
